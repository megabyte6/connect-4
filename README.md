    - Download the latest installer for your system.
    - Run the installer.
    - Have fun! üëç
- Portable instructions:
    - Head to [the latest release](https://github.com/megabyte6/connect-4/releases/latest).
    - Download the correct `.zip` for your system.
    - Extract the files.
    - Navigate to the `bin` folder.
    - Run `connect-4` (or `connect-4.bat` if you're on Windows).

Note:

- The installers are currently only available for Windows.
- If you're on Windows and wish to use a portable build, you can use `connect4-win-x64-x.x.zip` (which ships with a JVM) or `connect4-win-x64-portable-x.x.zip` (which has a windows executable. This option is recommended).
